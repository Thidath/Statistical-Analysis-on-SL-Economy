Comprehending global socio-economic trends is critical for making educated decisions in an era of growing globalization and interconnection. This research explores a thorough examination of socioeconomic data from many countries across the world, derived from the World Bank dataset. This project's main goal was to identify recurring patterns and draw practical conclusions for Sri Lanka's economic situation.

It is more important than ever to navigate economic crises with skill as the world faces previously unheard-of difficulties. As a result, this paper looks at how different countries handled comparable situations and tries to identify lessons and best practices that could be applied to Sri Lanka.
A strategy with multiple facets was used to accomplish these aims. Many methods of data visualization were applied to show complex relationships and patterns in the dataset. To find hidden patterns and project possible paths, advanced data modeling techniques were also used.
Moreover, the analysis goes beyond simple modelling and visualization; it also includes a qualitative analysis of the choices and approaches used by nations dealing with comparable economic difficulties. Through the integration of empirical data and these findings, the paper endeavors to develop well-informed suggestions specific to Sri Lanka's particular situation
